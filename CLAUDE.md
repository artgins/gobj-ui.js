# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repo.

## ⚠️ First step: read the yunetas CLAUDE.md

**Before doing anything in this repo, read the yunetas SDK's `CLAUDE.md`.**
This repo is normally checked out as the `kernel/js/gobj-ui` git submodule of
yunetas, so it lives at `/yuneta/development/yunetas/CLAUDE.md` (standalone
clone: `github.com/artgins/yunetas`, `CLAUDE.md` at the root). It carries the
framework-wide rules that also govern this codebase: always-braces, no silent
errors, gobj-js gotchas, JS GUI conventions (logical DOM class names, no
transitions, icon-only mobile buttons, Bulma `!important`, `yui_icons`), and
the two-line consumption model of this very repo. This file only adds the
gobj-ui-specific layer on top.

## This repo in the yunetas ecosystem

- Two maintained lines: **`main`/v2** (declarative shell
  `C_YUI_SHELL/NAV/PAGER/WIZARD` — all new work lands here; consumed locally
  by `file:` from wattyzer and `yunos/js/*`) and **`v1`** (frozen legacy stack,
  maintenance-only; estadodelaire/hidraulia consume the published npm
  `@yuneta/gobj-ui@^1.x`).
- The yunetas submodule tracks `main`/v2. To ship: commit on the right branch
  here, `npm publish` when releasing, then **bump the `kernel/js/gobj-ui`
  submodule pointer in yunetas** (v2 only).
- This package installs its own copies of shared third-party libs (i18next,
  @antv/g6, maplibre-gl, tabulator-tables, tom-select, uplot,
  vanilla-jsoneditor) — consumers must `resolve.dedupe` them in their vite
  config or module-level singletons render blank.
- Validate any change with `npm install && npm run build && npm test`.
