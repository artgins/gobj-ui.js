# Changelog

`@yuneta/gobj-ui` — Yuneta UI library (v2 declarative shell on the GObject-JS
runtime). This file tracks the **v2 line** (`main`); the frozen v1 GClass GUI
stack is maintenance-only and versioned separately (`1.x`, npm dist-tag
`legacy`).

## 2.1.0

- **feat(shell): runtime nav API.** `C_YUI_SHELL` can now mutate its navigation
  at runtime: dynamic submenu items (`yui_shell_set_submenu`), per-tab state
  and a tab close affordance (`EV_NAV_ITEM_CLOSE`). Enables consumers to build
  data-driven tab sets (e.g. one tab per selected item) on top of the static
  `app_config.json` menu.
- **feat(inputs): `attach_clear()`.** Reusable helper
  (`src/yui_inputs.{js,css}`, exported from `index.js`) that adds a Bulma
  `.delete` clear (✕) button to any `.control` wrapping an `<input>`, shown
  only while the field has content; clears, refocuses and dispatches a
  synthetic `input` event on click. Its CSS scopes under `.control.has-clear`
  so it wins over Bulma's `.delete` regardless of stylesheet load order.
- **feat: gclass-root debug classes.** Each gclass root container is tagged
  with its `GCLASS_NAME` class (and the non-`$container` roots too), and the
  `$root`/`$layout` refs were unified to `$container` — a consistent DOM hook
  for debugging and CSS.
- **feat(icons): `yi-terminal` glyph.** FontAwesome 6 free-solid "terminal"
  (`>_` prompt) added to `yui_icons.css`, for CLI/console affordances.
- **refactor: source layout.** Moved sources under `src/` to mirror the v1
  layout; the package exports map resolves `./src/*`.

## 2.0.0

- Initial **v2** line: the declarative shell stack
  (`C_YUI_SHELL` / `C_YUI_NAV` / `C_YUI_PAGER` / `C_YUI_WIZARD`) on top of the
  legacy GObject-JS runtime. Consumed locally (via a `file:` dependency) by
  wattyzer and the in-repo `gui_agent`/`gui_treedb` yunos. The frozen v1 stack
  (`C_YUI_MAIN` / `WINDOW` / `TABS` / `ROUTING` + TreeDB editors + charts/maps)
  remains available as `@yuneta/gobj-ui@^1.x` on the npm registry.
