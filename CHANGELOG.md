# Changelog

`@yuneta/gobj-ui` — Yuneta UI library (v2 declarative shell on the GObject-JS
runtime). This file tracks the **v2 line** (`main`); the frozen v1 GClass GUI
stack is maintenance-only and versioned separately (`1.x`, npm dist-tag
`legacy`).

## 2.1.2

- **feat(dev): Developer window is now a yuno monitor.** `yui_dev.js` was
  reworked from a raw traffic dumper into a control/monitoring/audit console
  around a bounded in-memory buffer (last 600 messages), so view and filter
  changes repaint instantly from memory and reopening the window restores
  history:
  - **View selector (persistent):** `Detailed` (folding bullet payload),
    `Compact` (one line + inline summary), `Name only` (event name + time).
    The last choice is saved (`dev_view_mode`).
  - **Filters:** per-direction chips (outgoing / incoming / errors), a
    free-text search over event + command + payload, and a **Hide periodic**
    toggle that folds away recurring chatter — events matching
    `PERIODIC|TIMEOUT|HEARTBEAT|PING` or any signature seen ≥ 5 times (polls,
    heartbeats) — so the async detail is not drowned out. All persistent
    (`dev_hide_periodic`, `dev_filter_*`).
  - **Per-event mute (persistent):** hover ⊘ on any entry to silence that
    event/command signature; muted signatures show as removable chips
    (`dev_muted_events`).
  - **Stateful trace toggles + live stats strip:** trace chips light up when
    active (Automata shows its level); a footer strip shows shown/total,
    per-direction counts, hidden count and total bytes.
  - Theme-aware chrome; the whole console moved into the window **body** (the
    C_YUI_WINDOW header/footer are single-row) with a title in the header.

## 2.1.1

- **feat(dev): bullet traffic log.** The Developer window's traffic view
  (`yui_dev.js` `info_traffic`) no longer instantiates one `vanilla-jsoneditor`
  per inter-event message — a heavy tree editor that forced a dark theme and
  read poorly as a log. Each message now renders as a compact bullet entry:
  a one-line header (direction arrow ⇢/⇠/⚠, bold event name, size, time) over a
  direction-coloured accent bar, with the `kw` as a folding bullet list —
  scalars inline and type-coloured, objects/arrays collapsed (`<details>`) so
  metadata and nested payloads stay folded until clicked. Timestamp fields get
  an ISO annotation; long strings are clipped (full text on hover). Theme-aware
  via `<html data-theme>`. Shared by both the legacy `C_YUI_WINDOW` (`setup_dev`)
  and the modal (`build_dev_panel`); `vanilla-jsoneditor` is dropped from this
  file (still used by the treedb/form gclasses).

## 2.1.0

- **feat(shell): runtime nav API.** `C_YUI_SHELL` can now mutate its navigation
  at runtime: dynamic submenu items (`yui_shell_set_submenu`), per-tab state
  and a tab close affordance (`EV_NAV_ITEM_CLOSE`). Enables consumers to build
  data-driven tab sets (e.g. one tab per selected item) on top of the static
  `app_config.json` menu.
- **feat(inputs): `attach_clear()`.** Reusable helper
  (`src/yui_inputs.{js,css}`, exported from `index.js`) that adds a Bulma
  `.delete` clear (✕) button to any `.control` wrapping an `<input>`, shown
  only while the field has content; clears, refocuses and dispatches a
  synthetic `input` event on click. Its CSS scopes under `.control.has-clear`
  so it wins over Bulma's `.delete` regardless of stylesheet load order.
- **feat: gclass-root debug classes.** Each gclass root container is tagged
  with its `GCLASS_NAME` class (and the non-`$container` roots too), and the
  `$root`/`$layout` refs were unified to `$container` — a consistent DOM hook
  for debugging and CSS.
- **feat(icons): `yi-terminal` glyph.** FontAwesome 6 free-solid "terminal"
  (`>_` prompt) added to `yui_icons.css`, for CLI/console affordances.
- **refactor: source layout.** Moved sources under `src/` to mirror the v1
  layout; the package exports map resolves `./src/*`.

## 2.0.0

- Initial **v2** line: the declarative shell stack
  (`C_YUI_SHELL` / `C_YUI_NAV` / `C_YUI_PAGER` / `C_YUI_WIZARD`) on top of the
  legacy GObject-JS runtime. Consumed locally (via a `file:` dependency) by
  wattyzer and the in-repo `gui_agent`/`gui_treedb` yunos. The frozen v1 stack
  (`C_YUI_MAIN` / `WINDOW` / `TABS` / `ROUTING` + TreeDB editors + charts/maps)
  remains available as `@yuneta/gobj-ui@^1.x` on the npm registry.
